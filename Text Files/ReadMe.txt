PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT STATE:
-We improved our game by using classes and it's methods to make easier understanding, and also made a new struct called Movement to assign movements on the game. All the objectives were accomplished.

MAIN DIFFICULTIES:
-We had some difficulties to rewrite the code and adapt it to the new instructions, but we managed it by making a new game and not rewriting the older version, this made our job so much easier.
-The class posts made some parts a little complicated to do, but with some effort we managed everything smoothly.

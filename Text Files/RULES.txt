Rules:
Type "2" on the main menu screen to play, then type a number from "1" to "99" to select a maze, which will be shown to you.
Your location on the maze is represented by the symbol "H", if you die, that symbol becomes "h".
The maze is composed of 3 elements: 
1) High-voltage fences/posts,  represented by the symbol "*", be careful not to touch them or you'll die and lose the game immediately.
2) Non-eletricfied fences, represented by "+", that don't kill you but stop your movement.
3) Exit gates, represented by "O".

Each "R" on the maze represents an evil robot. The robots are blind, unable to see you, the fences or the posts. However they can detect you by your smell and will try to catch you, always running after you in the direction of your scent. If a robot hits a fence or post it is destroyed, becoming unable to move, if a robot hits a dead robot it is also destroyed, if two robots hit each other, they are both destroyed. A dead robot is represented by the symbol "r". You cannot step on a dead robot.
Your objective is to escape the maze by reaching the exit gates. To do that, it might be useful to move in specific ways so as to trick the robots into hitting the fences/posts or one another, therefore becoming incapacitated and unable to follow you. You can also simply try to make a run for the exits, dodging them along your way. If you either hit an electrified fence/post or a robot catches you, you lose, but if you reach an exit, you win the game!
At the start of each round you will be shown the maze as it currently is and will have the choice to move in one of eight directions...
NW  N  NE
W       E
SW  S  SE
...by pressing the following keys respectively:
q   w   e
a       d
z   x   c
you may also stay in your place by pressing "s".
After you move, each of the robots will move by id number, always in the direction of your scent.
Good game and good luck!(Press 0 to return to the Main Menu)

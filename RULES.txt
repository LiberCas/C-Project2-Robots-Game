Rules:
Type "2" on the main menu screen to play, then type a two digit number from "01" to "99" to select a maze, which will then be shown to you.
Your location on the maze is represented by the symbol "H", if you die, that symbol becomes "h".
The maze is composed of high-voltage fences and posts represented by the symbol "*", be careful not to touch them or you'll lose the game immediately, and also non-eletricfied fences,represented by "+", that doesn't kill you, but unables you to move to that place, and also, the exit gates, represented by "O".
Each "R" on the maze represents an evil robot. The robots are blind, unable to see the fences or posts. However they can detect you by your smell and will try to catch you always running after you in the direction of your scent. If a robot hits an fence or post it is destroyed, becoming unable to move, if a robot hits a dead robot it is also destroyed, if two robots hit each other, they are both destroyed. A dead robot is represented by the symbol "r".
Your objective is to escape the maze by reaching the exit gates, you can destroy all robots, either by running into the electric fences/posts or into one another, or you can simply escape them. You can do this by manipulating the Robots inability to see the maze or each other as well as their determination to always follow your scent to get them to be destroyed. If you either hit a fence/post or a robot catches you, you lose, but if you reach a exit gate before losing, you win the game!
At the start of each round you will be shown the maze as it currently is and will have the choice to move in one of eight directions...
NW  N  NE
W       E
SW  S  SE
...by pressing the following keys respectively:
q   w   e
a       d
z   x   c
you may also stay in your place by pressing "s".
After you move, each of the robots will move by id number, always in the direction of your scent.
Good game and good luck!
